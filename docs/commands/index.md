# Commands Reference

BMAD provides 15 slash commands for managing your agile development workflow. Each command is designed for a specific phase and purpose.

---

## How Commands Work

Commands are markdown files in `~/.claude/commands/bmad/` that define interactive workflows. When you type a command like `/prd`, Claude Code loads the command definition and guides you through the process.

**Quick tip:** Type `/workflow-status` anytime to see which command to run next.

## Initialization Commands

<h3 id="workflow-init">/workflow-init</h3>

Initialize BMAD in your project. This creates the project configuration and sets up the output directory structure.

**When to use:** At the start of any new project

**Output:** `bmad/config.yaml`

#### Example

```
User: /workflow-init

Claude: Welcome to BMAD! I'll initialize your project.

## Project Configuration

What is your project name?
> Real-time Chat Application

What type of project is this?
1. web-app
2. mobile-app
3. api
4. game
5. library
6. other
> 1

## Project Level

Based on scope, select the appropriate level:

| Level | Stories | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 0 | 1 | Bug fix |
| 1 | 1-10 | Single feature |
| 2 | 5-15 | Feature set |
| 3 | 12-40 | System integration |
| 4 | 40+ | Enterprise |

For a chat app with user auth, real-time messaging, channels,
and notifications, I recommend Level 2.

Select level (0-4):
> 2

## Created Configuration

```yaml
# bmad/config.yaml
project_name: "Real-time Chat Application"
project_type: "web-app"
project_level: 2
output_folder: "docs"

bmm:
  workflow_status_file: "docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml"
  sprint_status_file: "docs/sprint-status.yaml"

paths:
  docs: "docs"
  stories: "docs/stories"
  tests: "tests"
```

Created directories:
- docs/
- docs/stories/

Project initialized! Run /workflow-status to see next steps.
```

---

<h3 id="workflow-status">/workflow-status</h3>

Check your project's current progress and get recommendations for what to do next.

**When to use:** Anytime you're unsure what to do next

**Output:** Status display (no file)

#### Example

```
User: /workflow-status

Claude: ## Real-time Chat Application - Workflow Status

### Project Info
- Type: web-app
- Level: 2 (Medium feature set)
- Output: docs/

### Phase Status

| Phase | Document | Status | File |
|-------|----------|--------|------|
| 1 - Analysis | Product Brief | ✓ Complete | docs/product-brief.md |
| 2 - Planning | PRD | ✓ Complete | docs/prd.md |
| 2 - Planning | UX Design | Optional | - |
| 3 - Solutioning | Architecture | ⚠ In Progress | - |
| 4 - Implementation | Sprint Plan | Pending | - |

### Recommendation

**Current Focus:** Phase 3 - Solutioning

Continue with `/architecture` to complete the system architecture design.

After architecture is complete:
1. Run `/solutioning-gate-check` to validate
2. Proceed to `/sprint-planning`

### Quick Stats
- Documents: 2/4 complete
- Estimated remaining: Architecture, Sprint Plan
```

## Phase 1 - Analysis Commands

<h3 id="product-brief">/product-brief</h3>

Create a comprehensive product brief that defines the problem space, target audience, and business goals.

**When to use:** Starting a new product (Level 1+, required for Level 2+)

**Output:** `docs/product-brief.md`

**Prerequisite:** `/workflow-init`

#### Example

```
User: /product-brief

Claude: I'll help create a product brief for Real-time Chat Application.

## Executive Summary

In 2-3 sentences, what does this product do?
> A team collaboration platform focused on real-time communication.
> Combines chat, voice, and video with deep integrations for
> developer tools.

## Problem Statement

What problems does this solve? I'll structure them:

1. **Communication silos:** Teams use multiple apps (Slack, Discord, Teams)
2. **Context switching:** Developers lose focus switching between chat and IDE
3. **Limited customization:** Existing tools have rigid workflows

Is this accurate?
> Yes, also add "Poor code sharing experience"

Added: **Poor code sharing:** Pasting code in chat loses formatting and context

## Target Audience

Primary users:
> Software development teams, 5-50 people
> Tech-forward companies
> Remote-first teams

Secondary users:
> Individual developers in open source communities

## Solution Overview

Based on problems, your solution will:
- Unified chat, voice, video in one app
- IDE extensions (VS Code, JetBrains)
- Rich code snippets with syntax highlighting
- Customizable workflows and bots

## Competitive Landscape

Key competitors:
- **Slack:** Market leader, expensive, slow
- **Discord:** Gaming-focused, poor enterprise features
- **Teams:** Microsoft-only, complex

Your differentiation:
> Developer-first experience, superior code handling,
> privacy-focused (self-hostable)

## Business Model

How will you monetize?
> Freemium - free for small teams (<10)
> Pro: $8/user/month
> Enterprise: $15/user/month (SSO, audit logs)

## Success Metrics

How will you measure success?
> - 1000 teams in 6 months
> - 40% weekly active users
> - <200ms message delivery
> - NPS > 50

## Constraints and Risks

Technical constraints:
> - Must support 10k concurrent users
> - End-to-end encryption required

Risks:
> - Slack network effects
> - Feature parity expectations

## Phase 3 - Solutioning Commands

<h3 id="architecture">/architecture</h3>

Design the system architecture including components, data models, APIs, and technology choices.

**When to use:** Level 2+ projects after PRD

**Output:** `docs/architecture.md`

**Prerequisite:** `docs/prd.md`

#### Example

See the [System Architect skill documentation](../skills/#system-architect) for a complete architecture example.

---

<h3 id="solutioning-gate-check">/solutioning-gate-check</h3>

Validate that the architecture addresses all requirements from the PRD.

**When to use:** After completing architecture, before sprint planning

**Output:** Status display (no file)

**Prerequisites:** `docs/prd.md`, `docs/architecture.md`

#### Example

```
User: /solutioning-gate-check

Claude: I'll validate your architecture against the PRD.

Loading: docs/prd.md, docs/architecture.md

## Functional Requirements Check

| FR | Description | Addressed | Notes |
|----|-------------|-----------|-------|
| FR-001 | Authentication | ✓ | Auth service, JWT, OAuth |
| FR-002 | Real-time messaging | ✓ | WebSocket service, Redis |
| FR-003 | Channels/DMs | ✓ | Channel service |
| FR-004 | Code sharing | ✓ | Message service + Prism.js |
| FR-005 | Search | ✓ | Elasticsearch |
| FR-006 | Notifications | ✓ | Push service, FCM |

## Non-Functional Requirements Check

| NFR | Requirement | Solution | Status |
|-----|-------------|----------|--------|
| NFR-001 | <200ms messages | WebSocket + Redis PubSub | ✓ |
| NFR-001 | <500ms search | Elasticsearch | ✓ |
| NFR-002 | E2E encryption | Signal protocol | ✓ |
| NFR-003 | 10k users | Horizontal scaling, sharding | ✓ |
| NFR-004 | 99.9% uptime | Multi-AZ, failover | ✓ |

## Gap Analysis

### Addressed
All functional and non-functional requirements have corresponding
architecture components.

### Potential Concerns

1. **Message ordering:** Architecture mentions "eventual consistency"
   but FR-002 requires strict ordering. Consider:
   - Vector clocks for ordering
   - Single leader per channel

2. **Search latency:** Elasticsearch is specified but indexing
   strategy not detailed. Consider:
   - Index message on write vs. async
   - Partial word matching approach

3. **File attachments:** FR-002 mentions file sharing but
   architecture doesn't specify:
   - Storage solution (S3?)
   - CDN for delivery
   - Virus scanning

### Recommendations

1. Add message ordering strategy to architecture
2. Detail Elasticsearch indexing approach
3. Add file attachment subsystem

## Gate Status: CONDITIONAL PASS

Address the 3 concerns above before proceeding to sprint planning.

Would you like me to help update the architecture document?
> Yes

[Updates architecture.md with the missing details]

Re-running gate check...

Gate Status: PASS ✓

Ready for /sprint-planning

#### Example

See the [Scrum Master skill documentation](../skills/#scrum-master) for a complete sprint planning example.

---

<h3 id="create-story">/create-story</h3>

**When to use:** Need to add a story outside of sprint planning

**Output:** `docs/stories/STORY-XXX.md`

#### Example
