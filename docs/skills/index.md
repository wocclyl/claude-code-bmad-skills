# Skills Reference

BMAD provides 9 specialized skills (AI agents) that handle different aspects of the agile development workflow. Each skill has specific responsibilities, commands, and outputs.

## How Skills Work in Claude Code

Skills are markdown files that define agent behavior. When you use a BMAD command, Claude Code loads the appropriate skill to handle your request.

## Executive Summary
What problem does this product solve? (2-3 sentences)
> Small businesses struggle to manage inventory across multiple
> sales channels. They need a unified system that syncs stock
> levels in real-time.

## Target Audience
Who are your primary users?
> Small retail business owners with 1-5 locations, selling both
> in-store and online (Shopify, Amazon, eBay)

## Problem Statement
Let me structure the core problems:

1. **Overselling:** Stock sells on one channel but isn't updated on others
2. **Manual updates:** Hours spent updating inventory across platforms
3. **No visibility:** Can't see total inventory at a glance
4. **Lost sales:** Items show out-of-stock when available elsewhere

Is this accurate?
> Yes, also add difficulty with purchase orders

## Solution Overview
Based on these problems, your solution should:
- Real-time sync across all connected channels
- Unified dashboard for all inventory
- Automated low-stock alerts
- Purchase order management

## Success Metrics
How will you measure success?
> - Reduce overselling incidents by 90%
> - Save 10+ hours/week on manual updates
> - 95% inventory accuracy

## Business Objectives
What are your business goals?
> - MRR of $50k in 12 months
> - 500 paying customers
> - Integrations with top 5 sales platforms

  }

  async delete(tenantId, id) {
    const product = await this.findById(tenantId, id);
    if (!product) return false;
    await product.destroy();
    return true;
  }

  async list(tenantId, { page = 1, limit = 20, search } = {}) {
    const where = { tenantId };
    if (search) {
      where[Op.or] = [
        { name: { [Op.iLike]: `%${search}%` } },
        { sku: { [Op.iLike]: `%${search}%` } }
      ];
    }

    return this.Product.findAndCountAll({
      where,
      limit,
      offset: (page - 1) * limit,
      order: [['createdAt', 'DESC']]
    });
  }
}
```

#### 3. Product Controller

Creating: src/controllers/productController.js
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const { validateProduct } = require('../middleware/validation');

router.post('/', validateProduct, async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const product = await req.productService.create(
      req.tenantId,
      req.body
    );
    res.status(201).json(product);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.name === 'SequelizeUniqueConstraintError') {
      return res.status(409).json({
        error: 'SKU already exists'
      });
    }
    next(error);
  }
});

// ... GET, PUT, DELETE endpoints

module.exports = router;
```

#### 4. Tests

Creating: tests/unit/productService.test.js
```javascript
describe('ProductService', () => {
  describe('create', () => {
    it('should create a product with valid data', async () => {
      const data = {
        sku: 'TEST-001',
        name: 'Test Product',
        description: 'A test product'
      };

      const product = await productService.create(tenantId, data);

      expect(product.sku).toBe(data.sku);
      expect(product.name).toBe(data.name);
      expect(product.tenantId).toBe(tenantId);
    });

    it('should reject duplicate SKU for same tenant', async () => {
      // ... test implementation
    });
  });

  // ... more tests
});
```

#### Example: Brainstorming Session

```
User: /brainstorm

Creative Intelligence: What topic would you like to brainstorm?
> How to improve user onboarding for our inventory app

Which techniques would you like to use? (or 'all')
> 5 Whys, SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats

## 5 Whys Analysis

**Problem:** Users abandon onboarding before connecting their first channel

1. **Why?** The process takes too long (15+ minutes)
2. **Why?** Users must configure too many settings upfront
3. **Why?** We require all fields before proceeding
4. **Why?** The system needs complete data to function
5. **Why?** We haven't implemented progressive disclosure

**Root Cause:** Requiring complete configuration prevents users from experiencing value quickly

**Solution Direction:** Implement progressive onboarding with minimal required fields

## SCAMPER Analysis

**Substitute**
- Replace manual setup with templates (Shopify store, Amazon seller)
- Substitute text instructions with video walkthroughs

**Combine**
- Combine channel connection + product import into one step
- Merge similar configuration screens

**Adapt**
- Adapt successful onboarding from Slack (guided bot)
- Adapt e-commerce setup wizards

**Modify**
- Simplify to 3 steps: Sign up → Connect → Dashboard
- Reduce required fields to just email and channel

**Put to other uses**
- Use onboarding flow for re-engagement
- Turn into shareable team invitation flow

**Eliminate**
- Remove location setup (default to single location)
- Eliminate manual product entry (auto-import only)

**Reverse**
- Start with dashboard, then prompt to connect
- Show sample data first, then replace with real

## Six Thinking Hats

**White Hat (Facts)**
- Current completion rate: 35%
- Average time: 18 minutes
- Drop-off point: Channel authentication

**Red Hat (Emotions)**
- Users feel overwhelmed
- Frustration at OAuth complexity
- Excitement when they see dashboard

**Black Hat (Risks)**
- Simplified onboarding may miss critical settings
- Users may get stuck later
- Support burden could increase

**Yellow Hat (Benefits)**
- Higher completion rate
- Faster time-to-value
- Better first impression

**Green Hat (Creativity)**
- "Connect in 60 seconds" challenge
- Gamified progress
- Skip to dashboard with sample data

**Blue Hat (Process)**
- A/B test new flow
- Monitor completion and day-7 retention
- Iterate based on support tickets

## Recommendations

1. **Quick Win:** Reduce required fields to email + password only
2. **Medium Term:** Implement "Connect in 3 clicks" with smart defaults
3. **Future:** Progressive onboarding that reveals features over first week

## Using Skills Together

Skills work together across the workflow. Here's how they connect:

```
Business Analyst → Product Manager → System Architect → Scrum Master → Developer
     │                    │                 │                │            │
product-brief.md → prd.md → architecture.md → sprint-status.yaml → code
```

### Handoff Example

```
User: /product-brief
# Business Analyst creates docs/product-brief.md

User: /prd
# Product Manager reads product-brief.md
# Creates docs/prd.md

User: /architecture
# System Architect reads prd.md
# Creates docs/architecture.md

User: /sprint-planning
# Scrum Master reads prd.md and architecture.md
# Creates docs/sprint-status.yaml and docs/stories/

User: /dev-story STORY-001
# Developer reads the story file and architecture
# Implements the code
```

Each skill automatically loads outputs from previous phases, maintaining context throughout the workflow.
