## Attribution & Credits

<div style="background: #f0f7ff; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #0066cc; margin: 20px 0;">

**This project is a Claude Code native conversion of the BMAD Method.**

The original **BMAD Method** was created by the [BMAD Code Organization](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD). All credit for the underlying methodology, workflow concepts, and agile framework goes to the original creators.

This conversion adapts the BMAD Method to work natively with Claude Code's skills, commands, and configuration system, making it seamlessly integrated into the Claude Code development experience.

## What is BMAD Method for Claude Code?

BMAD (Business Methodology for AI Development) transforms Claude Code into a full-featured agile development environment. Instead of using external tools or complex setups, everything works through Claude Code's native features:

- **9 Specialized Skills** - AI agents for different roles (Analyst, PM, Architect, Developer, etc.)
- **15 Workflow Commands** - Slash commands for every development phase
- **4 Development Phases** - Analysis → Planning → Solutioning → Implementation
- **Token-Optimized** - 70-85% reduction through helper patterns

### Key Benefits

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Native Integration** | Uses Claude Code's built-in skills and commands system |
| **Complete Workflow** | From product brief to deployed code |
| **Right-Sized Planning** | 5 project levels from single changes to enterprise systems |
| **Cross-Platform** | Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and WSL |
| **No Dependencies** | Pure Claude Code - no npm, Python, or external tools |

## Example Session

Here's what a typical BMAD session looks like:

```markdown
User: I want to build a task management app

Claude: I'll help you build that! Let me initialize BMAD in your project.

> /workflow-init

Created bmad/config.yaml with:
- Project: Task Management App
- Level: 2 (Medium feature set)
